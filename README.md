This repository features all the projects of Holberton School's "low-level programming" section done by Mateo Gallo from C#18.

All of these projects where done in the C programming language using the code editors Vi and Emacs.

C is a general purpose, Turing-complete, compiled, programming language known as one of the most influential and used languages in history. It was developed between 1969 and 1972 by Dennis Ritchie as an evolution of the B programming language. Similar to B, its main focus was the implementation of operative systems like Unix.

This language features a low-level interaction with the system, which means the interaction between the programmer and the computer is quite close, allowing a
